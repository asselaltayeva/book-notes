## Hackers & Painters: Big Ideas from the Computer Age
*by Paul Graham*

Hacking =>  To the popular press, "hacker" means someone who breaks into computers. Among programmers it means a good programmer. To programmers, "hacker" connotes mastery in the most literal sense: someone who can make a computer do what he wants — whether the computer wants to or not.

1.  I would have realized that there was a name for what I was doing: sketching. As far as I can tell, the way they taught me to program in college was all wrong. You should figure out programs as you're writing them, just as writers and painters and architects do. Realizing this has real implications for software design. It means that a programming language should, above all, be malleable. A programming language is for thinking of programs, not for expressing programs you've already thought of. It should be a pencil, not a pen.

2. The way to create something beautiful is often to make subtle tweaks to something that already exists, or to combine existing ideas in a slightly new way. 

3. Big companies want to decrease the standard deviation of design outcomes because they want to avoid disasters. But when you damp oscillations, you lose the high points as well as the low. This is not a problem for big companies, because they don't win by making great products. Big companies win by sucking less than other big companies.

4. The place to fight design wars is in new markets, where no one has yet managed to establish any fortifications. That's where you can win big by taking the bold approach to design, and having the same people both design and implement the product. Microsoft themselves did this at the start. So did Apple. And Hewlett-Packard. I suspect almost every successful startup has.

5. When we interviewed programmers, the main thing we cared about was what kind of software they wrote in their spare time. You can't do anything really well unless you love it, and if you love to hack you'll inevitably be working on projects of your own.

6. Just like painting, you learn to hack mostly by hacking. 

7. Maybe it would be good for hackers to act more like painters, and regularly start over from scratch, instead of continuing to work for years on one project, and trying to incorporate all their later ideas as revisions.

8. The other way makers learn is from examples. For a painter, a museum is a reference library of techniques. For hundreds of years it has been part of the traditional education of painters to copy the works of the great masters, because copying forces you to look closely at the way a painting is made. Hackers, likewise, can learn to program by looking at good programs-- not just at what they do, but the source code too. 

9. Relentlessness wins because, in the aggregate, unseen details become visible.

10. Empathy is probably the single most important difference between a good hacker and a great one.

11. After all, you only get one life. You might as well spend it working on something great.

12. Let me see and decide for myself.
