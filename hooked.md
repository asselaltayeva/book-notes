## Hooked: How to Build Habit-Forming Products  
*by Nir Eyal and Ryan Hoover*

---

### Introduction

> “Habits are automatic behaviors triggered by situational cues: things we do with little or no subconscious thought.”

**Q: How do companies, producing little more than code,form such strong user habits?**  
Because they:

- Attach their products to **internal triggers**
- Link services to users' **daily routines and emotions**
- Manufacture habits through repeated exposure to **hooks**

The more often users run through a hook cycle, the more likely they are to form a habit.

### Chapter 1: The Habit Zone
> A habit is when not doing an action causes a bit of pain.

**Q**: Are you building a vitamin or a painkiller?

- Customers form routines around a product and become less price-sensitive
- Game developers delay asking for money until a habit is formed
- The “Smile Graph” shows that user engagement grows over time with repeated use
- Users invest time, data, effort, social capital, or money**, making it harder to leave
- Hooked users often become brand evangelists, promoting the product to others
- A product must be 10× better than what it's replacing to override old habits
- Behaviors are LIFO(Last In, First Out): new habits are fragile
- Algorithms improve with use → better product experience → more usage 
- Habit-forming potential = Frequency × Perceived Utility
- A habit forms when not doing something causes discomfort (the “itch”)
